Nitsan
- +1 zoom remote control
- having a good time refactoring the tennis kata
- appreciate this new setup (seems to work great)
  - just use someone's local env.
  - remote control with zoom: seems to work well enough
  - positively surprised by this
- curious to see where we can get this tennis code, with more extracting of methods

Matt
- felt self-conscious as typer
- appreciate doing auto-refactorings
- appreciate the team's patience and flexibility (something different from python approvals)
- glad we dropped the gitpod option, and get to coding faster
- zoom remote control seems to work good enough for working on a single computer
- nice to have more people typing

Joss
- liked the stepping in to make sure to learn new things as opposed to familiar methods
- liked getting hints, but at one point it was too much - already had an idea where to go but kept receiving guidance
